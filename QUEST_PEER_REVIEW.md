# Quest Platform - Peer Review Guide

**Purpose:** Compare current implementation against original vision in QUEST_ARCHITECTURE.md
**Updated:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** Production Live - Ready for Review

---

## üéØ REVIEW OBJECTIVE

This document guides peer reviewers (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or human developers) to evaluate:

1. **Architectural Alignment** - Does implementation match design?
2. **Code Quality** - Is the codebase maintainable and production-ready?
3. **Technical Debt** - What shortcuts were taken? Are they acceptable?
4. **Missing Features** - What's documented but not implemented?
5. **Performance** - Does it meet stated goals ($0.44/article, 2-3 min generation)?

---

## üìã QUICK START FOR REVIEWERS

### What's Working Right Now (Verify These)

**Live Production URLs:**
- Frontend: https://relocation.quest
- Backend API: https://quest-platform-production-b8e3.up.railway.app/api/health
- Sample Article: https://relocation.quest/portugal-digital-nomad-visa-2025-complete-application-guide

**Quick Health Check:**
```bash
# Test backend
curl https://quest-platform-production-b8e3.up.railway.app/api/health | jq

# Test article retrieval
curl https://quest-platform-production-b8e3.up.railway.app/api/articles/ | jq

# Test frontend
curl -I https://relocation.quest
```

**Expected Results:**
- Health check: `"database": "healthy"` (Redis may show unhealthy - that's OK)
- Articles API: Returns 3+ articles with proper JSON structure
- Frontend: 200 OK response

## üìä COMPARISON: VISION vs. REALITY

### Architecture Document
**Reference:** `QUEST_ARCHITECTURE_V2.3.md` (or latest version)

### Critical Questions for Reviewer

#### 1. Database Schema Alignment
**Architecture States:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE articles (
    content TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Plain markdown
    hero_image_url TEXT,
    -- ...
);
```

**Reality Check:**
- Does `backend/app/agents/content.py` return plain markdown or JSON?
- Does `backend/app/api/articles.py` have adapter code (`_serialize_article`)?
- **If adapter exists:** This is technical debt - document it

**Review Action:**
```bash
# Check content agent output
grep -A 20 "def generate" ~/quest-platform/backend/app/agents/content.py

# Check for adapter functions
grep -n "_serialize" ~/quest-platform/backend/app/api/articles.py
```

#### 2. 4-Agent Pipeline Completeness
**Architecture States:** 4 agents (Research, Content, Editor, Image)

**Reality Check:**
- ‚úÖ ResearchAgent: Which APIs are integrated? (Should be 6: Perplexity, Tavily, Firecrawl, SERP.dev, Critique Labs, Link Up)
- ‚úÖ ContentAgent: Claude Sonnet 4.5 working?
- ‚úÖ EditorAgent: Quality scoring implemented?
- ‚úÖ ImageAgent: FLUX + Cloudinary working? How many images per article?

**Review Action:**
```bash
# Check research agent integrations
grep -i "perplexity\|tavily\|firecrawl\|serp\|critique\|linkup" ~/quest-platform/backend/app/agents/research.py

# Count API integrations
grep -c "API_KEY" ~/quest-platform/backend/app/core/config.py
```

#### 3. Cost Analysis Match
**Architecture States:** Target <$0.50 per article

**Reality Check from QUEST_TRACKER.md:**
- Current cost per article?
- Infrastructure costs match projections?
- AI API costs as expected?

**What to Look For:**
- Cache hit rate (should be 40%+)
- Perplexity costs reduced by caching
- Image generation costs ($3/1000 articles)

#### 4. Queue System Implementation
**Architecture States:** BullMQ with Redis for background jobs

**Reality Check:**
- Is Redis deployed and connected?
- Are jobs queued or executed synchronously?
- Worker process separated from API gateway?

**Review Action:**
```bash
# Check for queue implementation
ls ~/quest-platform/backend/app/queue/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Queue directory missing"

# Check orchestrator execution
grep -i "bullmq\|queue\|worker" ~/quest-platform/backend/app/agents/orchestrator.py
```

radon cc app/agents/ -a -nb

# Check type coverage
mypy app/agents/ --ignore-missing-imports
```

#### API Endpoints (`backend/app/api/`)

### Phase 3: Performance & Metrics

#### Generation Speed
**Target:** 2-3 minutes per article

**Test:**

cd ~/quest-platform/backend
time python3 generate_full_article.py
```

**Acceptable Range:** 90-210 seconds
**If slower:** Check Perplexity API latency, Claude response times

#### Cost Per Article
**Target:** <$0.50 per article

**Check QUEST_TRACKER.md for:**
- Current average cost
- Cache hit rate (should be 40%+)
- API usage breakdown

**Red Flags:**
- Cost >$0.60/article
- Cache hit rate <30%
- Image generation failing (increasing retry costs)

#### Quality Scores
**Target:** Average >80/100

**Query Database:**
```bash
NEON_CONNECTION_STRING="postgresql://..." psql -c \
  "SELECT AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality,
          MIN(quality_score) as min_quality,
          MAX(quality_score) as max_quality
   FROM articles WHERE quality_score IS NOT NULL;"
```

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES (Pre-Documented)

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Schema Mismatch (Architectural)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** Workaround exists (`_serialize_article()` adapter)

**Problem:**
- Content agent returns nested JSON: `{"article": {"content": "markdown"}}`
- Database expects plain TEXT: `content: "# Markdown..."`
- Adapter extracts markdown at API layer

**Proper Fix:**
- Update `backend/app/agents/content.py` to return plain markdown
- Remove adapter in `backend/app/api/articles.py`
- Retest article generation

**Reviewer Action:** Document if this is acceptable technical debt or requires immediate fix

#### 2. Missing Research APIs (5 of 6)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** Only Perplexity integrated

**Missing:**
- Tavily (research fallback)
- Firecrawl (web scraping)
- SERP.dev (search results)
- Critique Labs (fact-checking)
- Link Up (link validation)

**Impact:** Single point of failure, no research redundancy

**Reviewer Action:** Assess risk of Perplexity downtime

#### 3. No Queue System
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** Synchronous execution

**Impact:** Won't scale past 100 articles/day

**Workaround:** Current volume (<10 articles/day) doesn't require queue

**Reviewer Action:** Is this acceptable for MVP launch?

## Codex Peer Review (October 9, 2025)

### Findings (ordered by severity)

1. **Queue/worker architecture incomplete**  
   - Jobs are still executed synchronously in the FastAPI process even though they are pushed onto Redis (`backend/app/api/articles.py:105-124`).  
   - The dedicated worker process is only a keep-alive loop and never consumes the queue (`backend/app/worker.py:1-32`).  
   - This conflicts with the architecture‚Äôs goal of isolating long-running generation in BullMQ workers.  
   **Recommendation:** Implement queue polling/acknowledgement in `worker.py`, and deploy it as a separate Railway service so the API can return immediately while workers process jobs.

2. **ResearchAgent skips mandated pre-flight checks**  
   - Architecture v2.3 requires consulting `QUEST_RELOCATION_RESEARCH.md`, deduping topics, and using SEO signals before calling Perplexity (`QUEST_ARCHITECTURE_V2_3.md:830-841`).  
   - `backend/app/agents/research.py:36-122` goes straight from embedding generation to cache lookup/API call without checking that playbook.  
   **Recommendation:** Incorporate the documented checks (topic priority, duplication, SEO inputs) before running `_check_cache`/`_query_perplexity`.

3. **Placement/rainmaker front-ends absent**  
   - The roadmap calls for three Astro front-ends (`QUEST_ARCHITECTURE_V2_3.md:17`, `1692-1800`), but only `relocation.quest` has source code; `frontend/placement.quest` and `frontend/rainmaker.quest` are empty directories.  
   **Recommendation:** Bootstrap those apps so routing, deployment, and shared packages are validated for all three domains.

### Positive Observations

- Markdown rendering and inline hero/content imagery now match the architecture‚Äôs expectations after the recent API/Frontend updates (`backend/app/api/articles.py:138-254`, `relocation-quest/src/pages/[slug].astro:26-199`).  
- Compared with the October 7 legacy snapshot, the project now has a clean FastAPI + Astro split with Neon as source of truth, fulfilling the intent of the `TURBOREPO-FASTAPI-ARCHITECTURE.md` plan.

### Suggested Next Steps

1. Finish the BullMQ worker implementation and deploy it separately from the API gateway.  
2. Add the research pre-check workflow so topic selection follows the documented governance.  
3. Scaffold `placement.quest` and `rainmaker.quest` front-ends (even as thin shells) to unlock multi-site testing.  
4. Expand monitoring/cost dashboards to close the remaining gaps between implementation and `QUEST_ARCHITECTURE_V2_3.md`.
