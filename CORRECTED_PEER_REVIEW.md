# CORRECTED Peer Review Summary

## What Actually Happened

**Frontend Repo Location**: `~/relocation-quest/` (NOT cloned - it was already here!)

**Working Article (Before)**: 
- https://relocation.quest/best-digital-nomad-cities-portugal
- ✅ Markdown parsed correctly to HTML
- ✅ Hero image displayed
- ❌ No content image (API didn't return content_image_1_url)

**Broken Articles (Now)**:
- https://relocation.quest/best-cafes-for-remote-work-in-lisbon-2025
- ❌ Raw markdown showing
- ✅ Hero image works
- ❌ No content image

## Root Cause Analysis

My commits broke it:
- `fd3f811` - "Simplify: Single content image at bottom" ← This broke markdown parsing
- `a2a82d3` - "Fix: Dynamic content image injection" ← Also problematic
- `41ee84c` - "Add content image support" ← Started the issues

**The peer reviewer was RIGHT**: Backend bugs prevent content images from ever reaching frontend.

## The 3 Bugs (Confirmed)

### Bug #1: API Missing Columns ✅ CONFIRMED
`~/quest-platform/backend/app/api/articles.py` lines 153-156, 195-198, 269-272
- Missing: `content_image_1_url`, `content_image_2_url`, `content_image_3_url`

### Bug #2: Orchestrator Not Saving ✅ CONFIRMED  
`~/quest-platform/backend/app/agents/orchestrator.py` line ~238
- Only saves hero image, never saves content images

### Bug #3: Frontend Broken by My Changes ✅ CONFIRMED
`~/relocation-quest/src/pages/[slug].astro`
- My recent commits broke what was working
- Need to revert to earlier working version OR fix properly

## What Next Reviewer Needs to Do

1. **Fix Backend** (Bugs #1 & #2) - These are REAL blocking issues
2. **Revert Frontend** to working state (before commit `41ee84c`)
   OR fix the markdown parsing in current code
3. **Test**: Portugal article should still work, new articles should get content images

## File Locations (CORRECTED)

- Backend: `~/quest-platform/backend/`
- Frontend: `~/relocation-quest/` ← Already exists!
- Both repos: Push to GitHub to deploy
