## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Monthly Operating Costs (1000 articles/month)

**Fixed Infrastructure:**
- Railway (Backend + Worker): $30/month
- Neon PostgreSQL: $50/month
- Vercel (Frontend): $0/month (free tier)
- **Subtotal:** $80/month

**Variable API Costs:**
- Perplexity Research: ~$300/month (with 40% cache savings)
- Claude Content: ~$50/month
- OpenAI Embeddings: ~$0.10/month
- Replicate Images: ~$3/month
- **Subtotal:** ~$353/month

**Total: ~$433/month = $0.43 per article**

### Cost Optimization

**Intelligent Caching (40% savings):**
- pgvector similarity search
- 30-day cache TTL
- Expected ROI: $200/month saved after ramp-up

## 🔍 Known Issues & Limitations

### Non-Critical Issues

1. **Worker Implementation (Ready for Railway)**
   - Status: Worker process defined but needs Railway to run continuously
   - Impact: Local testing requires manual article generation
   - Solution: Railway will run worker as separate process via Procfile

2. **ImageAgent Testing (Not Blocking)**
   - Status: Code ready, not tested end-to-end locally
   - Impact: Images may need troubleshooting in production
   - Solution: Test in production, graceful failure implemented

3. **Background Processes (Cleanup Needed)**
   - Status: Multiple stale background shells from testing
   - Impact: None (local development only)
   - Solution: Clean up after deployment

### Mitigated Risks

✅ JSON Parsing Bug - FIXED
✅ Database Schema Issues - FIXED
✅ Type Mismatches - FIXED
✅ Connection Pooling - CONFIGURED
✅ Error Handling - IMPLEMENTED
