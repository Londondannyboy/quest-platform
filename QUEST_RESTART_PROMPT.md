## üéØ Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Testing (1-2 hours)
1. **Test natural language improvements**
   - Generate 3 test articles
   - Run through Originality.ai for AI detection score
   - Target: <40% flagged as AI (goal from Reddit research)

2. **Test Gemini compression**
   - Verify compression ratios (expect 80-90% reduction)
   - Validate content quality maintained
   - Confirm cost savings ($0.15 ‚Üí $0.004)

3. **Validate full pipeline**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **Need to test natural language improvements** - Generated with Reddit V2 prompts but not yet validated with AI detection tools
2. **Need to validate Gemini compression quality** - Architecture in place but not yet tested in production
3. **Research governance still bypassed** - Cluster routing designed but not integrated
4. **Documentation drift** - Need to update all QUEST_* docs with tonight's changes

**Note:** All code changes deployed to Railway. System is operational, ready for testing.
