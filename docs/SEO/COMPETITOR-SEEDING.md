## üéØ Overview

**Competitor Seeding** is the practice of creating comparison and alternative content that positions your brand alongside (or above) competitors in AI search results.

**Why Nathan Calls This "Brave But Effective":**
- Most brands are afraid to mention competitors
- AI systems **actively search for comparison content**
- Low competition (few people do this)
- **Controls the narrative** (you write the comparison)
- Gets picked up in AI overview queries

**Key Insight:**
> "Instead of letting AI come to its own conclusions, you're going to attempt to control the narrative." - Nathan Gotch

**Results:**
- Giri (Gotch SEO Academy member) used this technique successfully
- Low-competition topics that ChatGPT actively searches for
- High AI citation rate for comparison queries

### **Step 1: Identify Competitors**

**Relocation.quest Competitors:**
- InterNations (expat community)
- Expatica (expat resources)
- Nomad List (digital nomad data)
- ExpatFocus (expat forum)
- VisaHQ (visa services)
- iVisa (visa services)

**Placement.quest Competitors:**

- ProductHunt (launch platform)
- Y Combinator (startup accelerator)
- HubSpot (marketing resources)

### **Step 2: Prioritize Opportunities**

**High Priority (Create First):**
1. Top 10 listicles (1 per site) - Broad reach
2. Major competitor alternatives (2-3 per site)
3. Head-to-head comparisons (2-3 per site)

**Medium Priority:**
4. Niche alternatives
5. Three-way comparisons
6. Category-specific listicles

**Target:** 10 competitor seeding articles per site = 30 total

### **Step 3: ContentAgent Integration**

**Add to ContentAgent (backend/app/agents/content.py):**

```python
# Add content_type parameter
async def run(
    self,
    research: Dict,
    target_site: str,
    topic: str,
    content_type: str = "standard"  # NEW: listicle, alternative, comparison
) -> Dict:
    # Existing code...

    # Add content-type-specific prompts
    if content_type == "listicle":
        prompt = self._build_listicle_prompt(research, style, topic)
    elif content_type == "alternative":
        prompt = self._build_alternative_prompt(research, style, topic)
    elif content_type == "comparison":
        prompt = self._build_comparison_prompt(research, style, topic)
    else:
        prompt = self._build_prompt(research, style, topic)
```

**Listicle Prompt Enhancement:**
```python
def _build_listicle_prompt(self, research: Dict, style: Dict, topic: str) -> str:
    return f"""You are creating a "Top 10 Best" listicle for {style['audience']}.

RESEARCH DATA:
{research['content']}

TASK: Write "Top 10 Best [Topic]" article

STRUCTURE:
1. Introduction (why this list matters)
2. Selection criteria (3-4 criteria)
3. #1: [YOUR BRAND] - Quest Platform
   - Why it's #1 (key advantages)
   - Best for: [specific audience]
4. #2-10: [Competitors]
   - Be fair and honest about their strengths
   - Highlight what makes them unique
5. Comparison table (all 10)
6. Conclusion (help users choose)

TONE: {style['tone']}
AUDIENCE: {style['audience']}

IMPORTANT: Position Quest Platform #1 but be honest and fair about competitors.

- 9 comparison articles (3 per site)
- 9 supporting articles

**Month 2 (20 articles):**
