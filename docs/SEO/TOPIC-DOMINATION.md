## üéØ Overview

**Topic Domination** = Creating comprehensive content coverage of your niche through volume + quality.

**Key Insight from Nathan Gotch:**
> "One plumbing website has 7 pages (0 visitors). Another has 500 pages (23,000 visitors). Sheer volume can win even if quality is average. But volume + quality? Unbeatable."

**Why This Works for AI SEO:**
- ChatGPT searches 1-100+ sources per query (not just 1-10)
- More pages = more opportunities to be discovered
- Topic clusters establish topical authority
- AI systems reward comprehensive coverage

**Goal:** 300-500 pages per site within 12 months

## üìä The Power of Volume

### **Real-World Example (Nathan's Case Study)**

**Small Plumbing Site:**
- 7 web pages
- 0 organic visitors/month
- Limited topic coverage

**Large Plumbing Site:**
- 500 web pages
- 23,000 organic visitors/month
- Comprehensive topic coverage

**Result:** 500/7 = 71x more pages = ‚àû more traffic

### **AI SEO Multiplier Effect**

Traditional SEO:
```
10 pages √ó 5% chance each ranks = 0.5 expected rankings
```

AI SEO:
```
500 pages √ó 5% chance each cited = 25 expected citations
+ Topic authority bonus = 35+ total citations
```

**More pages = More AI discovery opportunities**

## üìù Content Production Workflow

### **Step 1: Topic Discovery**

**Option A: Competitor Research**
```
1. Find top 5 competitors per site
2. Use Screaming Frog to crawl their sites
3. Export all URLs
4. Categorize by topic cluster
5. Identify gaps in our coverage
```

**Option B: ChatGPT Agent**
```
Prompt: "Generate 100 article topics for a [niche] website targeting
[audience]. Focus on topics that digital nomads/job seekers/entrepreneurs
frequently search for. Format as: Topic | Intent | Difficulty"
```

**Option C: Google Search Console**
```
1. Publish initial 50 pages
2. Wait 30 days
3. Check GSC for query impressions
4. Identify high-impression, low-click queries
5. Create dedicated pages for these queries
```

### **Step 2: Prioritization**

**Score each topic:**
```
Priority Score = (Search Volume √ó 0.4) + (Competition √ó 0.3) +
                 (AI Opportunity √ó 0.3)

Where:
- Search Volume: 1-10 (1 = low, 10 = high)
- Competition: 10-1 (10 = low competition, 1 = high)
- AI Opportunity: 1-10 (will AI systems cite this?)
```

**Priority Tiers:**
- **High (Score 8-10):** Create in Month 1-3
- **Medium (Score 5-7):** Create in Month 4-6
- **Low (Score 1-4):** Create in Month 7-12

### **Step 3: Content Creation**

**Use ContentAgent with templates:**
```python
# Generate country visa guide
await content_agent.run(
    research=research_data,
    target_site="relocation",
    topic="Portugal Digital Nomad Visa: Complete Guide",
    content_type="guide",  # vs listicle, comparison, alternative
    template="country_visa_guide"
)
```

**Templates ensure consistency:**
- Same structure across similar pages
- Complete coverage of topic
- Optimized for AI (TL;DR, FAQs, etc.)

### **Step 4: Quality Gates**

**Before publishing:**
- [ ] TL;DR present (150 words)
- [ ] Key Takeaways (3-5 bullets)
- [ ] H2/H3 structure clear
- [ ] FAQs included (4-10 Q&A)
- [ ] Sources cited with links
- [ ] Word count 1500-2500
- [ ] Images added (1-3)
- [ ] PDF generated
- [ ] JSON schema embedded
