# Press Release Workflow for LLM Authority Building

**Version:** 2.3.0
**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Target Audience:** Content Team, Marketing
**Status:** Active Process

---

## üéØ Overview

This workflow covers the **manual process** of submitting strategic articles to Press Wire to build authority and get content ingested into LLM training data.

**Key Principle:**
> We do NOT build a press release automation system. We use established services (Press Wire, PR Newswire) because THEIR authority is what gets us into LLM training data.

**Why This Works:**
- Press release services are trusted by LLM training pipelines
- Content gets distributed to news sites, syndication networks
- High authority backlinks and brand mentions
- LLMs discover content in multiple authoritative contexts

**Cost:** $149 per release via Press Wire
**Cadence:** 5-10 strategic articles per month
**Budget:** $750-$1,500/month

## üìã Article Selection Criteria

### **What Makes an Article "Strategic"?**

**‚úÖ Good Candidates for Press Releases:**

1. **Evergreen Comprehensive Guides**
   - Won't date quickly (avoid "2025" unless truly annual)
   - Comprehensive depth (2000+ words)
   - Authoritative coverage
   - Example: "Complete Guide to Digital Nomad Visas in Europe"

2. **High Search Volume Topics**
   - Topics people frequently ask LLMs about
   - Google Trends shows sustained interest
   - Multiple related keywords
   - Example: "Best Countries for Remote Workers"

3. **Unique Insights or Data**
   - Original research or analysis
   - Exclusive comparisons
   - Data-driven conclusions
   - Example: "2026 Digital Nomad Cost of Living Analysis: 50 Cities Compared"

4. **Foundation Content**
   - Core pillar content for your niche
   - Referenced by other articles
   - Linked from multiple pages
   - Example: "Remote Work Tax Guide: Country-by-Country Breakdown"

**‚ùå Poor Candidates for Press Releases:**

- Timely/news-based content (dates quickly)
- Listicles without unique insight
- Personal opinion pieces
- Product reviews
- Short guides (<1500 words)

### **Monthly Selection Process**

**Step 1: Review Published Articles**
```bash
# Get last 30 days of articles
SELECT id, title, slug, word_count, quality_score, views
FROM articles
WHERE published_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND status = 'published'
ORDER BY quality_score DESC, views DESC;
```

**Step 2: Score Each Article**

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-10) |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Evergreen value | 30% | ___ |
| Search volume | 25% | ___ |
| Content depth | 20% | ___ |
| Uniqueness | 15% | ___ |
| Authority potential | 10% | ___ |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **___** |

**Step 3: Select Top 5-10**
- Aim for score >7.5/10
- Mix of topics (don't all submit visa guides)
- Spread across all 3 sites (relocation, placement, rainmaker)

- [ ] Verify all statistics have citations
