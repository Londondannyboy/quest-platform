## 🚀 Three Ways to Deploy to GitHub

### Option 1: Use the Helper Script (EASIEST) ⭐

```bash
cd quest-architecture
./push-to-github.sh
```

The script will guide you through:
- Creating the GitHub repository
- Pushing all files
- Setting up remotes

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (FAST)

```bash
cd quest-architecture

# Create and push in one command
gh repo create quest-architecture \
  --description "Multi-Site Content Intelligence Platform with AI-Assisted Production" \
  --public \
  --source=. \
  --push

# View in browser
gh repo view --web
```

### Option 3: Manual Git Commands (TRADITIONAL)

**Step 1:** Create repository on GitHub
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Name: `quest-architecture`
- Description: `Multi-Site Content Intelligence Platform with AI-Assisted Production`
- **Important**: Don't initialize with README
- Click "Create repository"

**Step 2:** Push your local repository
```bash
cd quest-architecture

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quest-architecture.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

```

### Method 2: Personal Access Token

2. Create token with `repo` scope
3. Use token as password when pushing

### Method 3: SSH Keys

2. Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys
3. Use SSH URL: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/quest-architecture.git`
